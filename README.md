Full-stack personal website to showcase my projects and blog posts. Utilising Next.jsâ€™ dynamic routing, the user can
view each project or blog. Using React hooks such as useEffect and useState, users can toggle their desired theme from
light to dark mode in a click of a button. Blog posts are written in markdown and rendered as HTML. Unit tested using
React Testing Library and Jest. Deployed with AWS Amplify, using AWS Management Console and Amplify CLI.

## What is this project about?

I created this project for two purposes, to be able to showcase my most recent projects as well as a dedicated space to
post my blogs.

## Why did I decide to create this project?

My initial idea was to create a modern responsive website that showcases my projects & blog posts all in one
place.

## Why did I decide to use the technologies/languages that I did?

I decided to use [React](https://www.reactjs.org) for this project as I initially designed a modular website with a need
for multiple components being implemented, as well as various states such as dark mode theme toggle and search
functionality.

Since I've learnt [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) I have implemented it into every project I have made, so
it was a no-brainer to include it in this one. Typescript allows for a better development experience.

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a great tool to create static sites and was easy to implement with react and
typescript. Creating a Next.js app with Typescript is simple, just by running this command:
`npx create-next-app@latest --ts`
will create a Next app with typescript included out of the box. So no need to fiddle with ts config files and googling
why your
typescript files aren't compiling the way you want!

I decided to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) due to it being easy to implement into a NextJS application. By
using Tailwind I learnt about mobile-first design principles and adapting responsiveness to different screen sizes.
