# What is a responsive layout model?

In this day and age, there is a plethora of different screen sizes. From standard mobile phones to tablets, laptops and
large
monitor displays. A responsive layout allows a webpage to adapt based on the screen size it is being viewed
on.It is important that software developers cater their webpage to not just fit on every screen size, but make sure it
is well-designed both visually and for the user experience. Gone are the days where developers had to 'hack' their CSS
with 'inline-block' and 'float'. Nowadays developers use Css Grid or flexbox in order to design their web pages.

## What is CSS Grid?

Css grid allows components to be aligned into columns and rows. its main benefit is it is great for large layouts that
look great when divided into sections. CSS Grid is two-dimensional, which means components can be aligned on either the
X or Y axis.

## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox aligns elements inside a container, which is, well you guessed it, flexible. the elements inside can expand or
shrink when needed. Flexbox is one dimensional compared to the two dimensions of CSS Grid.
