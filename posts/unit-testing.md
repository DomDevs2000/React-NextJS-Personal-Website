**Unit testing** is a critical aspect of software development that helps ensure that individual units of code are
functioning as intended, and that changes made to code do not break existing functionality. In Java, there are a number
of tools and frameworks available to make unit testing easier and more efficient.
JUnit is one of the most widely used Java unit testing frameworks. It provides a simple and straightforward API for
writing and running tests, and supports test cases, fixtures, test suites, and test runners.

Unit testing in Java works by writing test cases for individual units of code (such as methods or classes) to verify
their functionality and correctness. The goal of unit testing is to isolate each unit of code and test it in isolation
from the rest of the code. This helps ensure that each unit of code works as expected and that any changes made to the
code do not break existing functionality.

Here are the basic steps to implement unit testing in Java:

1) Choose a testing framework: There are several popular Java testing frameworks, such as JUnit, TestNG, and Mockito,
   that you can use to write and run unit tests.

2) Write test cases: For each unit of code that you want to test, write a test case that tests its behavior and verifies
   that it works as expected.

3) Run the tests: Use the testing framework to run the test cases. The testing framework will check the results of each
   test case and report whether the test passed or failed.

4) Analyze the results: If any test cases fail, examine the failure and fix the code if necessary. If all test cases
   pass, the unit of code can be considered thoroughly tested and ready for deployment.

5) Repeat for each unit of code: Repeat the above steps for each unit of code that you want to test.

Unit testing helps improve the quality of the code by catching errors early in the development process, making it easier
and less time-consuming to fix them. Additionally, unit testing provides documentation for the code, as the test cases
serve as examples of how the code should behave in various scenarios.

In this blog post I will be using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/) to explain and give examples of
unit testing. To get started with JUnit, you
will need to write test cases to verify the functionality of individual units of code. A
test case is a method that takes inputs, runs the code under test, and verifies that the output meets expectations.
JUnit provides several annotations to mark methods as test cases, including @Test, @Before, and @After.

**@Test** is used to indicate that a method is a test case. The test case should verify that the code being tested
produces
the expected results. If the code produces unexpected results, the test case will fail, signaling that there is a bug
that needs to be fixed.

**Here is an example:**

```
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class ThisIsAnExampleTest {
  
  @Test
  public void testExample() {
    Example example = new Example();
    int result = example.subtract(5, 3); 
    assertEquals(2, result); 
  }
}
```

In this example, the ThisIsAnExampleTest class contains a single test case testExample, which tests the _subtract_
method of
the
Example
class. The test case takes two inputs (5 and 3), calls the _subtract_ method with these inputs, and then verifies that
the result is 2 using the assertEquals method from JUnit. If the result of the _subtract_ method is not 2, the test case
will fail
and an error message will be displayed indicating that the test failed.

In conclusion, unit testing is a crucial practice in software development that helps ensure that code is
functioning as expected and that changes made to code do not break existing functionality. JUnit is a popular Java unit
testing framework that provides a simple and straightforward API for writing and running tests. By incorporating unit
testing into your development process, you can save time and effort, and improve the overall quality of your Java
applications. Additionally, you can catch bugs early in the development process and improve the overall
quality of your code. It also makes it easier to make changes to the code in the future, as you can be confident that
your changes won't break existing functionality.
