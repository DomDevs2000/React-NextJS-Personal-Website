In this project, I created a video game library in which users can search for their favourite games, developers, genres or platforms. I created this using Vanilla JS, NodeJS with ExpressJS for the backend, PassportJS for the user authentication, and SQL for database storage. Users can use the login/signup button to create an account or login to an existing account, and then create their own wishlists of games by marking each game as "Played, Playing or "Want To Play".
