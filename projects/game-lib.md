## What is this project?
In this project, I created a video game library in which users can search for their favourite games, developers, genres
or platforms.

## Why I made this project
 I created this site using Vanilla Javascript and standard CSS. Pug(formerly known as Jade) was used as the template engine that was
 being served from the back end, which itself was created with Node & Express. The app fetches data from a 3rd-party API
 called [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs). Once the data has been fetched, I used pug templates to render the data 
 in the DOM. 

### To do for the future / work in progress
In the future i would like users to be able to create an account and add games to their wishlist and mark each game as
"Currently playing", "Played" or "Want to play".
