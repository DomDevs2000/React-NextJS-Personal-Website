I created this API to allow users to create, select or delete specfic lorem ipsum notes to be used in any website where
they may want random lorem impsum text by using a 3rd-party API. I used NodeJS with ExpressJS for the API endpoints and
MongoDB for the database. For unit-testing I used Jest and Supertest to test the API endpoints.
