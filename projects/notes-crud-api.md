# What is this project about?
I created this API to allow users to create, select or delete specfic lorem ipsum notes to be used in any website where
they may want random lorem impsum text by using a 3rd-party API. I used NodeJS with ExpressJS for the API endpoints and
MongoDB for the database. For unit-testing I used Jest and Supertest to test the API endpoints.

## Why did I decide to create this project?
I wanted to create  back-end only project to experiment and increase my skills dealing with databases and API design.

## Why did I decide to use the technologies/languages that I did?

Using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) is a great framework for developing server-side code. Creating an express server is much more simpler and easier to read than creating a NodeJs http server.

I decided to use [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for this project 

Since I started learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) I have implemented it into every project I have made, so
it was a no-brainer to include it in this one. Typescript allows for a better development experience.

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a great tool to create static sites and was easy to implement with react and
typescript Creating a NextJs app with Typescript is simple. Running this command:
```npx create-next-app@latest --ts```
will create a
Next app with typescript included out of the box.

I decided to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) due to it being easy to implement into a React/NextJS application. By
using Tailwind I
learnt about mobile first design principles and adapting responsiveness to different screen sizes.
