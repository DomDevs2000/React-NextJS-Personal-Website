# What is this project about?

I created this project for two purposes, to have my own custom website with my own blog and project showcase, as well as to learn React with NextJS with Typescript.

## Why did I decide to create this project?

My initial idea was to create a modern responsive website that showcases my skills and my other projects all in one place. I decided to use TailwindCSS due to it being easy to implement into a NextJS application. By using Tailwind i learnt about mobile first design principles.

## Why did i decide to use the technologies/languages that i did?
