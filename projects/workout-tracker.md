# What is this project about?

Created a web application that allows users to track workouts that can be viewed, edited and deleted.
Functionality includes account and workout creation for strength and cardio training with data such as sets, reps,
weight, distance and time.
Current roadmap includes converting the project to React Native,so it can be used as a native mobile application
available on the Apple and Android app stores.
Deployed to Vercel, leveraging both Vercel CLI and GitHub Actions for efficient CI/CD.

## Why did I decide to create this project?

My initial idea was to create a modern responsive website that allows users to track their workouts as well as edit and
delete previous ones.

## Why did I decide to use the technologies/languages that I did?

I decided to use [React](https://www.reactjs.org) for this project as I initially designed a modular website with a need
for multiple components being implemented and interchanged based on the page content. Using React Hooks such as useState
and useEffect, I could save data and edit previously stored data in a PostgreSQL database when the page component needs
it.

I decided to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) due to it being easy to implement into a NextJS application. By
using Tailwind I
learnt about mobile first design principles and adapting responsiveness to different screen sizes.
